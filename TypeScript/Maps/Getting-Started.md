# Getting Started

* This section explains briefly about how to create Maps in your application with TypeScript

* You can learn how to configure Map with simple steps. In this example, you can learn how to configure USA population map with customized appearance and tooltip.

### Create a Map

You can easily create the Maps widget by using the following steps.

## Add Libraries

1.First create an TypeScript Project and add the following references in the app.ts file

 For common getting started of TypeScript , you can refer [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/js/typescript).

The default type definition file **ej.web.all.d.ts** needs to include the support for type-checking while initializing any of the Syncfusion widgets. 

The important step you need to do is to copy the ej.web.all.d.ts file into your project and then need to refer it in your TypeScript application (app.ts file), so that you will get the intelliSense support and also the compile time type-checking.

You can find the ej.web.all.d.ts file in the following location,

(installed location)\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{{ site.releaseversion }}\JavaScript\assets\typescript

Apart from ej.web.all.d.ts file, it is also necessary to make use of the **jquery.d.ts** file in your TypeScript application, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

2.Add the following script reference in the HTML page  

{% highlight html %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
        <link href="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/bootstrap-theme/ej.web.all.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
        <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/ej.web.all.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jsrender/1.0pre35/jsrender.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script> 
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, `ej.web.all.min.js` script reference has been added for demonstration purpose. It is not recommended to use this for deployment purpose, as its file size is larger since it contains all the widgets. Instead, you can use [CSG](http://csg.syncfusion.com/# "") utility to generate a custom script file with the required widgets for deployment purpose.


#### Preparing Shape Data

The Shape Data collection describing geographical shape information can be obtained from [GEOJSON format shapes](https://www.syncfusion.com/uploads/user/uploads/Maps_GeoJSON.zip). 

In this example, USA shape is used as shape data by utilizing the `United States of America.json` file in the following folder structure obtained from downloaded Maps_GeoJSON folder.

`..\ Maps_GeoJSON\All Countries with States`

You can assign the complete contents in “United States of America.json” file to new JSON object. For your better understanding, a JS file “usa.js” is already created to store JSON data in JSON object “usMap”.




{% highlight javascript %}

var usMap = //Paste all the content copied from the JSON file//
	
{% endhighlight %}



### Prepare Data Source

The datasource is populated with JSON data relative to shape data and stored in JSON object. USA population as datasource is used for better understanding.
 The “populationData.js” file is used to store JSON data in JSON object “populationData”.


{% highlight javascript %}

var populationData = [
        { name: "California", population: "38332521" },
        { name: "Texas", population: "26448193" },
        { name: "New York", population: "19651127" },
        { name: "Florida", population: "19552860" },
        { name: "Illinois", population: "12882135" },
        { name: "Pennsylvania", population: "12773801" },
        { name: "Ohio", population: "11570808" },

        { name: "Michigan", population: "9895622" },
        { name: "North Carolina", population: "9848060" },
        { name: "New Jersey", population: "8899339" },
        { name: "Virginia", population: "8260405" },

        { name: "Massachusetts", population: "6692824" },
        { name: "Arizona", population: "6626624" },
        { name: "Indiana", population: "6570902" },
        { name: "Tennessee", population: "6495978" },
        { name: "Missouri", population: "6044171" },
        { name: "Maryland", population: "5928814" },
        { name: "Wisconsin", population: "5742713" },
        { name: "Minnesota", population: "5420380" },
        { name: "Colorado", population: "5268367" },
        { name: "Alabama", population: "4833722" },
        { name: "South Carolina", population: "4774839" },
        { name: "Louisiana", population: "4625470" },
        { name: "Kentucky", population: "4395295" },
        { name: "Oregon", population: "3930065" },
        { name: "Oklahoma", population: "3850568" },
        { name: "Puerto Rico", population: "3615086" },
        { name: "Connecticut", population: "3596080" },
        { name: "Iowa", population: "3090416" },
        { name: "Mississippi", population: "2991207" },
        { name: "Arkansas", population: "2959373" },
        { name: "Utah", population: "2900872" },
        { name: "Kansas", population: "2893957" },
        { name: "Nevada", population: "2790136" },
        { name: "New Mexico", population: "2085287" },
        { name: "Nebraska", population: "1868516" },
        { name: "West Virginia", population: "1854304" },
        { name: "Idaho", population: "1612136" },
        { name: "Hawaii", population: "1404054" },
        { name: "Maine", population: "1328302" },
        { name: "New Hampshire", population: "1323459" },
        { name: "Rhode Island", population: "1051511" },
        { name: "Montana", population: "1015165" },
        { name: "Delaware", population: "925749" },
        { name: "South Dakota", population: "844877" },
        { name: "Alaska", population: "735132" },
        { name: "North Dakota", population: "723393" },
        { name: "District of Columbia", population: "646449" },
        { name: "Vermont", population: "626630" },
        { name: "Wyoming", population: "582658" }
]

{% endhighlight %}



You can refer to shape data and datasource as illustrated in the HTML page,

{% highlight html %}

	<!-- Shape data file-->
    <script src="usa.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
    <!-- Data source file-->
    <script src="populationData.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
{% endhighlight %}

## Initialize Map

1.Create a &lt;div&gt; tag and set the height and width to determine the map size. 
      		

{% highlight html %}
	
	<div id="Map" style="width: 900px; height: 600px;"></div>

{% endhighlight %}
  

2.Initialize the Map in ts file by using the `ej.Map` method. 

{% highlight javascript %}

/// <reference path="tsfiles/jquery.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="tsfiles/ej.web.all.d.ts" />

module MapComponent {
    $(function () {
        var MapSample = new ej.datavisualization.Map($("#Map"));               
      });
}

{% endhighlight %}

3.Add the **shapeData** property in the maps to render it in layers


{% highlight javascript %}

module MapComponent {
    $(function () {
        var MapSample = new ej.datavisualization.Map($("#Map"),{
            layers: [
                {
                    shapeData: usMap
                }]
            
        });               
      });
}
	

{% endhighlight %}
   

The above code renders a map with default properties and shape input provided through data in layers.


![](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img2.png)


## Data Binding in Map

The following properties in shape layers is used for binding data in Maps control.

* DataSource
* ShapeDataPath
* ShapePropertyPath

### DataSource

The `dataSource` property accepts collection values as input. For example, you can provide the list of objects as input.

### Shape Data Path 

The `shapeDataPath` property is used to refer the data ID in DataSource. For example, population MapData contains data ids ‘Name’ and ‘Population’. The `shapeDataPath` and `shapePropertyPath` properties are related to each other (refer to `shapePropertyPath` for more details).

### Shape Property Path

The `shapePropertyPath` property is similar to the `shapeDataPath` that refers the column name in the Data property of shape layers to identify the shape. When the values of the `shapeDataPath` property in the `dataSource` property and the value of `shapePropertyPath` in the Data property match, then the associated object from the `dataSource` is bound to the corresponding shape.



{% highlight javascript %}

	 $(function () {
        var MapSample = new ej.datavisualization.Map($("#Map"),{
            layers: [
                {
                    shapeData: usMap,
                    shapeDataPath: "name",
                    shapePropertyPath: "name",
                    dataSource: populationData
                }]
            
        });               
      });
    
	
{% endhighlight %}

### Customize Map Appearance 

You can customize the shape’s color by using `fill`, `stroke` and `strokeThickness` properties in `shapeSettings`.



{% highlight javascript %}


$(function () {
        var MapSample = new ej.datavisualization.Map($("#Map"),{
            layers: [
                {
                   shapeData: usMap,
                    shapeDataPath: "name",
                    shapePropertyPath: "name",
                    dataSource: populationData, 
                    enableSelection: false,
                    enableMouseHover: true,
                    shapeSettings: {
                        fill: "#9CBF4E",
                        strokeThickness: "0.5",
                        stroke: "White",
                        highlightStroke: "White",
                        highlightColor: "#BC5353",
                        highlightBorderWidth: "1"
                    }
                }]
            
        });               
      });


{% endhighlight %}



![](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img3.png)


### Customizing Map Appearance by Range

The Range color mapping is used to differentiate the shape’s fill based on its underlying value and color ranges. The `from` and `to` properties defines the value ranges and the `gradientColors` property defines the equivalent color ranges respective to their value ranges.

N> The `enableGradient` property value should be true to apply gradient colors for maps.


{% highlight javascript %}

$(function () {
        var MapSample = new ej.datavisualization.Map($("#Map"),{
            layers: [
                {
                    shapeData: usMap,
                    shapeDataPath: "name",
                    shapePropertyPath: "name",
                    dataSource: populationData,
                    enableSelection: false,
                    enableMouseHover: true,
                    shapeSettings: {
                        fill: "#9CBF4E",
                        strokeThickness: "0.5",
                        stroke: "White",
                        highlightStroke: "White",
                        highlightColor: "#BC5353",
                        highlightBorderWidth: "1",
                        valuePath: "name",
                        colorValuePath: "population",
                        enableGradient: true,
                        colorMappings:
                        {
                            rangeColorMapping: [
                                {
                                    from: 500000,
                                    to: 1000000,
                                    gradientColors: ["#9CBF4E", "#B8CE7B"]
                                },
                                {
                                    from: 1000001,
                                    to: 5000000,
                                    gradientColors: ["#B8CE7B", "#CBD89A"]
                                },
                                {
                                    from: 5000001,
                                    to: 10000000,
                                    gradientColors: ["#CBD89A", "#DEE2B9"]
                                },
                                {
                                    from: 10000001,
                                    to: 40000000,
                                    gradientColors: ["#DEE2B9", "#F1ECD8"]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                }]
            
        });               
      });

{% endhighlight %}



The following screenshot illustrates a Map with gradient color property enable.



![](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img4.png)


## Enable Tooltip

The tooltip is displayed only when `showTooltip` is set to ‘true’ in the shape layers. By default, it takes the property of the bound object that is referred in the `valuePath` and displays its content on hovering the corresponding shape. The `tooltipTemplate` property is used for customizing the template for tooltip.



{% highlight javascript %}

$(function () {
        var MapSample = new ej.datavisualization.Map($("#Map"),{
            layers: [
                {
                   // ...
                    shapeSettings: {
                        // ...
                        valuePath: "name",
                        // ...
                    },
                    showTooltip: true
                }]
            
        });               
      });

{% endhighlight %}



The following screenshot illustrates a map control displaying a Tooltip.



![](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img5.png)


## Legend

A Legend can be made visible by setting the `showLegend` property in `legendSetting`. 

### Interactive Legend

The legends can be made interactive with an arrow mark indicating the exact range color in the legend, when the mouse hovers the corresponding shapes. You can enable this option by setting `mode` property in `legendSettings` value as ‘Interactive’. The default value of `mode` property is ‘Default’ to enable the normal legend.

#### Title

Use `title` property to provide title for interactive legend.

#### Label

You can use `leftLabel` and `rightLabel` property to provide left and right labels for interactive legend.
