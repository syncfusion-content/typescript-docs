# Getting Started with TypeScript TreeMap

* This section explains briefly about how to create a TreeMap in your application with TypeScript.
* Here you can learn how to configure a TreeMap control in a real-time scenario where it is used to visually represent the percentage of growth in population in each continent. 
* It also provides a walk-through on some of the customization features available in TreeMap control.

## Create a TreeMap 

You can easily create the TreeMap widget by using the following steps.

## Add Libraries

 1.First create an TypeScript Project and add the following script reference in the app.ts page 
 
For common getting started of TypeScript , you can refer [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/js/typescript).

The default type definition file **ej.web.all.d.ts** needs to include the support for type-checking while initializing any of the Syncfusion widgets. 

The important step you need to do is to copy the ej.web.all.d.ts file into your project and then need to refer it in your TypeScript application (app.ts file), so that you will get the intelliSense support and also the compile time type-checking.

You can find the ej.web.all.d.ts file in the following location,

(installed location)\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{{ site.releaseversion }}\JavaScript\assets\typescript

Apart from ej.web.all.d.ts file, it is also necessary to make use of the **jquery.d.ts** file in your TypeScript application, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

2.Add the following script reference in the HTML page  

{% highlight html %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
        <link href="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/bootstrap-theme/ej.web.all.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
        <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/ej.web.all.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jsrender/1.0pre35/jsrender.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script> 
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
In the above code, `ej.web.all.min.js` script reference has been added for demonstration purpose. It is not recommended to use this for deployment purpose, as its file size is larger since it contains all the widgets. Instead, you can use [CSG](https://csg.syncfusion.com/ "") utility to generate a custom script file with the required widgets for deployment purpose.

## Initialize TreeMap

1.Create a <div> tag with specific id
	
   {% highlight html %}

<html> <body> <div id="TreeMap"></div> </body> </html>

{% endhighlight %}
  
2.The dataSource property of the TreeMap accepts the collection values as input.Populate the datasource of the  TreeMap data as JSON object. For example, you can use population data of countries to generate TreeMap data as illustrated in the following code sample.
	
   {% highlight html %}
var population_data = [
                   { Continent: "Asia", Region: "Southern Asia", Growth: 1.32, Population: 1749046000 },
                   { Continent: "Asia", Region: "Eastern Asia", Growth: 0.57, Population: 1620807000 },
                   { Continent: "Asia", Region: "South-Eastern Asia", Growth: 1.20, Population: 618793000 },
                   { Continent: "Asia", Region: "Western Asia", Growth: 1.98, Population: 245707000 },
                   { Continent: "Asia", Region: "Central Asia", Growth: 1.43, Population: 64370000 },
                   { Continent: "Europe", Region: "Europe", Growth: 0.10, Population: 742452000 },
                   { Continent: "America", Region: "South America", Growth: 1.06, Population: 406740000 },
                   { Continent: "America", Region: "Northern America", Growth: 0.85, Population: 355361000 },
                   { Continent: "America", Region: "Central America", Growth: 1.40, Population: 167387000 },
                   { Continent: "Africa", Region: "Eastern Africa", Growth: 2.89, Population: 373202000 },
                   { Continent: "Africa", Region: "Western Africa", Growth: 2.78, Population: 331255000 },
                   { Continent: "Africa", Region: "Northern Africa", Growth: 1.70, Population: 210002000 },
                   { Continent: "Africa", Region: "Middle Africa", Growth: 2.79, Population: 135750000 },
                   { Continent: "Africa", Region: "Southern Africa", Growth: 0.91, Population: 60425000 }
        ];
     {% endhighlight %}
   N> Population data is referred from [List of continents by population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_continents_and_continental_subregions_by_population)
 
3.The size of an object can be calculated by using the **WeightValuePath** of TreeMap
 
4.Initialize the TreeMap in ts file by using the `ej.TreeMap` method. 

{% highlight javascript %}

/// <reference path="tsfiles/jquery.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="tsfiles/ej.web.all.d.ts" />
module TreeMapComponent {
    $(function () {
        var treeMapSample = new ej.datavisualization.TreeMap($("#TreeMap"),{
                dataSource: population_data,
                weightValuePath: "Population", 
            
        });
    });
}

{% endhighlight %}

The following image displays a TreeMap with default properties using the above code. 

![TypeScript TreeMap GroupTreeMap Items using Levels](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img2.png)

## GroupTreeMap Items using Levels

You can group TreeMap Items using levels in TreeMap.

### Group Path

You can use `groupPath` property for every flat level of the TreeMap control. It is a path to a field on the source object that serves as the “Group” for the level specified. You can group the data based on the `groupPath` in the TreeMap control. When the `groupPath` is not specified, then the items are not grouped and the data is displayed in the order specified in the `dataSource`.

### Group Gap

You can use `groupGap` property to separate the items from every flat level and to differentiate the levels mentioned in the TreeMap control.

The following code sample explains how to group TreeMap Items using ‘Levels’

{% highlight javascript %}
  $(function () {
        var treeMapSample = new ej.datavisualization.TreeMap($("#TreeMap"),{
                dataSource: population_data,
                weightValuePath: "Population", 
                levels: [
                     { groupPath: "Continent", groupGap: 5}
                   ]
        });
    });
	
{% endhighlight %}


The following screenshot displays grouping of TreeMapItems using Levels.

![TypeScript TreeMap Customize TreeMap Appearance by Range](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img3.png)



## Customize TreeMap Appearance by Range

You can differentiate the nodes based on its value and color ranges using Range color. You can also define the color value range using From and To properties. 

### Color Value Path

The `colorValuePath` of TreeMap is a path to a field on the source object. You can determine the color for the object using `colorValuePath` of TreeMap.

The following code sample explains how to customize TreeMap Appearance by Range.

{% highlight javascript %}

 $(function () {
        var treeMapSample = new ej.datavisualization.TreeMap($("#TreeMap"),{
                dataSource: population_data,
                weightValuePath: "Population",
                levels: [
                    { groupPath: "Continent", groupGap: 5 }
                ],
                colorValuePath: "Growth",
                rangeColorMapping: [
                    { color: "#DC562D", from: "0", to: "1" },
                    { color: "#FED124", from: "1", to: "1.5" },
                    { color: "#487FC1", from: "1.5", to: "2" },
                    { color: "#0E9F49", from: "2", to: "3" }
                ]
        });
    });

{% endhighlight %}



The following screenshot displays customized TreeMap Appearance by Range

![TypeScript TreeMap Enable Tooltip](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img4.png)

## Enable Tooltip

You can enable the tooltip by setting `showTooltip` property to ‘true’. By default, it takes the property of the bound object that is referred in the `weightValuePath` and displays its content when the corresponding node is hovered. You can customize the template for tooltip using `tooltipTemplate` property.

### Leaf Item Settings

You can customize the Leaf level TreeMap items using `leafItemSettings`. The Label and tooltip values take the property of bound object that is referred in the `labelPath` when defined.

The following code sample displays how the tooltip is enabled.

{% highlight javascript %}

$(function () {
        var treeMapSample = new ej.datavisualization.TreeMap($("#TreeMap"),{
                dataSource: population_data,
                weightValuePath: "Population", 
                levels: [
                     { groupPath: "Continent", groupGap: 5}
                   ], 
                colorValuePath: "Growth",
                rangeColorMapping: [
                      { color: "#DC562D", from: "0", to: "1" },
                      { color: "#FED124", from: "1", to: "1.5" },
                      { color: "#487FC1", from: "1.5", to: "2" },
                      { color: "#0E9F49", from: "2", to: "3" }
                ],
                showTooltip:true,
                leafItemSettings: { labelPath: "Region" }
        });
    });
	
{% endhighlight %}



The following screenshot displays the TreeMap when the Tooltip is enabled.

![TypeScript TreeMap Legend](Getting-Started_images/Getting-Started_img5.png)

## Legend

You can set the color value of leaf nodes using TreeMap Legend. This legend is appropriate only for the TreeMap whose leaf nodes are colored using `rangeColorMapping`.

You can set ShowLegend property value to ‘_true_’ to make a Legend visible.

### Label for Legend

You can customize the labels of the legend item using `legendLabel` property of `rangeColorMapping`. 

The following code sample displays how to add labels for legend in a TreeMap.

{% highlight javascript %}

	$(function () {
        var treeMapSample = new ej.datavisualization.TreeMap($("#TreeMap"),{
                  dataSource: population_data,
                weightValuePath: "Population", 
                levels: [
                     { groupPath: "Continent", groupGap: 5}
                   ], 
                colorValuePath: "Growth",
                rangeColorMapping: [
                  { color: "#DC562D", from: "0", to: "1", **legendLabel: "0 - 1 %    Growth"** },
                  { color: "#FED124", from: "1", to: "1.5", **legendLabel: "1 - 1.5 % Growth"** },
                  { color: "#487FC1", from: "1.5", to: "2", **legendLabel: "1.5 - 2 % Growth"** },
                  { color: "#0E9F49", from: "2", to: "3", **legendLabel: "2 - 3 % Growth"** }                   
                ],
                showTooltip:true,
                leafItemSettings: { labelPath: "Region" },
                showLegend: true,
                legendSettings: {
                  showLegend:true,                                                                      
                  height:38,
                  width:690,
                }
        });
    });

{% endhighlight %}
