# Overview

The **Typescript** AutoComplete component is a textbox control that provides a list of suggestions based on your query. When you enter a text into the text box, the control performs a search operation and provides a list of results. There are several filter types available to perform the search.

## Key Features

* Multi word Search: Supports searching using multiple words

* Data binding: Supports data binding with JSON data and remote data.

* Template: Supports templates for the suggestion list content.

* Highlight Search: Supports highlighting the typed text in the suggestion list.

* Auto Fill: Allows the control to automatically select the first suggested item.

* Keyboard Interaction: Supports using the keyboard to focus on the control, navigate through the suggestion results, and select a value.
